# Smart Animal Monitoring System using IoT and Wireless Sensor Networks
## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Animal Monitoring System** is designed to track and analyze various health metrics of animals, such as **heart rate (BPM), temperature, and environmental conditions**, using IoT-based wireless sensor networks. This project helps farmers, veterinarians, and researchers monitor the well-being of animals in real time.

## 📋 Features
- 📡 **IoT-Enabled Monitoring**: Uses wireless sensors to collect real-time data.
- 📊 **Health Parameters Tracking**: Monitors BPM, temperature, and environmental factors.
- 🔗 **Cloud Integration**: Sends collected data to a cloud platform (e.g., Ubidots) for remote access.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Displays sensor readings in an interactive dashboard.
- 🔔 **Alert System**: Sends notifications if abnormal readings are detected.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Hardware**: NodeMCU ESP8266, Pulse Sensor, DHT22 Sensor, MQ-135 Gas Sensor, Water Level Sensor.
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, Python, Ubidots Cloud.
- **Communication**: WiFi-based IoT architecture.
